## Setup

This documentation assumes you have a Kubernetes cluster already available.

If you need help setting up a Kubernetes cluster please refer to [Kubernetes Setup](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/).

If you want to use GPUs, be sure to follow the Kubernetes [instructions for enabling GPUs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-gpus/scheduling-gpus/).

Arena doesn't have to run can be run within Kubernetes cluster. It can also be run in your laptop. If you can run `kubectl` to manage the Kubernetes cluster there, you can also use `arena`  to manage Training Jobs.

### Requirements

  * Kubernetes >= 1.10, kubectl >= 1.10
  * helm version [v2.8.2](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm) or later 
  * tiller with ths same version of helm should be also installed (https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-tiller)

### Steps

1\. Prepare kubeconfig file by using `export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf` or creating a `~/.kube/config`

2\. Install kubectl client

Please follow [kubectl installation guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

3\. Install Helm client

- Download Helm client from [github.com](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases)  
- Unpack it (tar -zxvf helm-v2.8.2-linux-amd64.tgz)
- Find the `helm` binary in the unpacked directory, and move it to its desired destination (mv linux-amd64/helm /usr/local/bin/helm)

Then run `helm list` to check if the the kubernetes can be managed successfully by helm.

```
# helm list
# echo $?
0
```

4\. Download the charts

```
mkdir /charts
git clone https://github.com/kubeflow/arena.git
cp -r arena/charts/* /charts
```

5\. Install TFJob Controller

```
kubectl create -f arena/kubernetes-artifacts/jobmon/jobmon-role.yaml
kubectl create -f arena/kubernetes-artifacts/tf-operator/tf-operator.yaml
```

6\. Install Dashboard

```
kubectl create -f arena/kubernetes-artifacts/dashboard/dashboard.yaml
```

7\. Install MPIJob Controller

```
kubectl create -f arena/kubernetes-artifacts/mpi-operator/mpi-operator.yaml
```

8\. Install arena

Prerequisites:

- Go >= 1.8

```
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/kubeflow
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/kubeflow
git clone https://github.com/kubeflow/arena.git
cd arena
make
```

`arena` binary is located in directory `arena/bin`. You may want add the directory to `$PATH`.


9\. Install and configure kube-arbitrator for gang scheduling(optional)

```
kubectl create -f arena/kubernetes-artifacts/kube-batchd/kube-batched.yaml
```

10\. Enable shell autocompletion

On Linux, please use bash

On CentOS Linux, you may need to install the bash-completion package which is not installed by default.

```
yum install bash-completion -y
```

To add arena autocompletion to your current shell, run source <(arena completion bash).

To add arena autocompletion to your profile, so it is automatically loaded in future shells run:

```
echo "source <(arena completion bash)" >> ~/.bashrc
```

Then you can use [tab] to auto complete the command

```
# arena list
NAME            STATUS   TRAINER  AGE  NODE
tf1             PENDING  TFJOB    0s   N/A
caffe-1080ti-1  RUNNING  HOROVOD  45s  192.168.1.120
# arena get [tab]
caffe-1080ti-1  tf1
```


11\. Enable Host network for training (optional)

The training is not `useHostNetwork` by default. If you'd like to run the training in HostNetwork. You can run the command below:

```
find /charts/ -name values.yaml | xargs sed -i "/useHostNetwork/s/false/true/g"
```

12\. Enable Loadbalancer in the public cloud (optional)

 Kubernetes can be run on AWS, GCE, Azure and Alibaba Cloud, and `LoadBalancer` is supported in their cloud provider. If you want to access tensorboard on the internet directly, you can run the command below:


```
find /charts/ -name "*.yaml" | xargs sed -i "s/NodePort/LoadBalancer/g"
```

> Warning: it's not encouraged to expose the service to the internet, because the service can be attacked by hacker easily.


13\. Change imagePullPolicy from `Always` to `IfNotPresent` (optional)

```
find /charts/ -name values.yaml| xargs sed -i "s/Always/IfNotPresent/g"
```

> Warning: this may cause the docker images are not up to date if it's already downloaded in node.
